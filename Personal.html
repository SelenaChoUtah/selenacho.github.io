									<h2>Who am I?</h2>
									<p>Hi, I’m Selena Cho — I  was born and raised 20 minutes south of Boston in Canton, MA, 
										with my parents, who immigrated from Guangzhou, China. Funny enough, I 
										didn’t speak a word of English until I started kindergarten, which taught 
										me to be independent and self-sufficient from a young age. That early experience 
										sparked my love of learning and trying new things — from athletics to crafts — 
										without fearing the stigma of being a beginner or the “dumb” one. Just because 
										I didn’t know something then didn’t mean I couldn’t learn. I’ve always believed 
										that if I put in the time, I can learn and succeed.
									</p>
									<p>
										I’ve always been curious about the world, probably thanks to my parents’ love of 
										travel. That sense of adventure stuck with me — I studied abroad in Hong Kong during 
										undergrad at UMass Amherst, which gave me the chance to explore all sorts of places 
										in Southeast Asia. Many of those adventures were solo, teaching me how to enjoy my
										own company and embrace the discomfort of the unknown. And, well… don’t tell my 
										parents, but I couch-surfed with random locals more than a few times — and lived 
										to tell the tale.									
									</p>

									<h2>I LOVE LEARNING NEW HOBBIES</h2>
                                    <p>I’m constantly picking up new hobbies — I find the process of starting from scratch 
                                        and working my way up incredibly satisfying. It might sound like I can’t stick to 
                                        one thing, but I promise I see them through to at least an adequate level! I love 
                                        diving into the details and learning the intricacies behind each one, whether it’s 
                                        mastering a trail on my bike or figuring out the perfect technique for wheel-thrown pottery.

                                    </p>

									<p>I skied a few days growing up, but before moving to Salt Lake, I hadn’t touched skis 
										in over 10 years. So honestly, I count my first real season of skiing when I moved here — 
										and now I’m in my fourth season. Like a lot of people, I got hooked on the idea of backcountry 
										skiing thanks to Cody Townsend’s The Fifty Project. I started watching it back in 2019 when 
										the series kicked off, and it sparked something in me. Even before I made the move to Salt Lake, 
										I bought a touring backpack — just trying to manifest that dream, you know?</p>
	
									<p>The 23–24 season was when it finally happened. I took my Avy 1 class through the University of Utah 
										with an awesome instructor, Will Ambler, and began my backcountry journey. What keeps me hooked 
										is that every time I go out, I learn something new. No two days are ever the same — the snowpack 
										is always changing with new snow, wind loading, sun exposure, or whatever else nature decides 
										to throw at you. And being in the Wasatch means there are endless places to explore. There’s 
										always a new line, a hidden stash, or a new challenge waiting out there.</p>

									<p>I was never an endurance runner; in fact, I was a sprinter back in high school, 
										and I could never stick to running on the road. I never understood others’ 
										obsession with it. Maybe it's the constant distraction of busy roads or the endless
										stops at traffic lights that put me off. I’ve run the Salt Lake City Marathon, and 
										it was an incredible experience — running alongside thousands of others and having 
										my friends hand me bacon at mile 23 — but still, something about it just doesn’t click.
										<br /><br />
										Trail running, on the other hand, puts me in a flow state. I’m often suffering way 
										harder on the trails, climbing steep elevations and grinding up mountains — yet somehow, 
										it keeps me coming back for more. Maybe it’s the privilege of being surrounded by the 
										silence of nature or the fact that I have no one to blame for my current suffering but myself. Trail running 
										has taught me to be kinder to myself and reminded me that no matter how tough life gets, I can always move forward, 
										one small step at a time. This year, I'll be running my first ultra race through a scholarship from the 
										<a href="https://www.womenofthewasatch.com/">Women of the Wasatch</a>, where I got a race entry to 
										the <a href="https://speedgoat.utmb.world/races/50K">UTMB Speedgoat 50k</a> taking place at the end of July. 
										Wish me the best of luck!

									<p>Before moving to Salt Lake City, I have never heard nor ever seen anyone mountain bike nor gravel bike. 
										Honestly speaking, I didn't know there was different types of biking, much less the variety of 
										enjoyment you can get out of it. I am in no means an adrenaline junkie or masochist, but something about 
										pedaling hard uphill and riding the flow downhill is something that is inexplicable.
